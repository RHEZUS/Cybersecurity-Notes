**Repository Name:** `Cybersecurity-Notes`

**Description (courte):**
Structured and comprehensive cybersecurity learning notes, covering fundamentals, application security, DevSecOps, cloud security, OSINT, tools, projects, monitoring, certifications, and references.

**Description (longue / README intro):**
This repository contains a complete, organized framework for learning and documenting cybersecurity concepts and practical skills. It is designed as a personal knowledge base but can be adapted for collaborative learning.

It is structured into the following sections:

1. **Meta:** Long-term goals, learning methodology, training plan, progress checklist, and learning journal.
2. **Fundamentals:** Core concepts in networking, systems, cryptography, and security models.
3. **Application Security (AppSec):** OWASP Top 10, secure coding practices, framework-specific security (PHP, JavaScript, Laravel, React, APIs), and checklists.
4. **DevSecOps:** CI/CD security, pipeline hardening, SAST/DAST/SCA scanning, infrastructure-as-code security (Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker), and DevSecOps templates.
5. **Cloud Security:** Fundamentals, AWS, Azure, GCP security notes, and cloud security checklists.
6. **OSINT:** Methodology, sources, social media analysis, email investigation, and OSINT tools.
7. **Tools:** Networking, web, system, and general security cheat sheets.
8. **Projects:** Hands-on labs and exercises for AppSec, DevSecOps, cloud security, and portfolio projects.
9. **Monitoring:** CVE tracking, security trend articles, conference notes, and analysis.
10. **Certifications:** Study notes, certification roadmap, and preparation material (Security+, eJPT, cloud security).
11. **References:** Books, blogs, RFCs, ISO/NIST standards.

**Purpose:**
